# Read this before anything

This file contains data of covid-19 in Champaign County.
This data is **non-official** and it was collected by me, Bruno Abreu.
The source is the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District webpage:

You can use this as you wish, but make sure that, every time data is presented, its non-official character is clearly warned.
